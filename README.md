### index.js is for initialization logic and data.js is to store data

### index.ejs sab kuch dikhayega or uske andr li ka jo anchor tag h wo redirect krega show route p and this is the get request and show route is to show the details of the specific listing

## We have toLocaleString() which convert which convert numbers to string with commas

### Create and New route Get request to -> /listings/new -> Form -> Submit krne k baad request 2nd route pr jayegi (create route pr jo ki POST route hoga) -> /listings

### Update and Edit Route -> sends a GET request to => /listings/:id/edit -> render edit form -> submit krte hi put request jayegi /listings/:id and show k andr hi edit route hoga

### We use ejsmate for layouts

### includes and layouts server the static and common code like header, footer etc.

### if we want to show anything over the image then we use card-img-overlay and in future i wanted to use it for the like button

### Validation -> from client to server -> checks the data which we are sending from client to server is correct or not. 1.When we enter data in the form, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. we make script.js inside js inside public folder to implement the bootstrap default error(blank) message instead of browser default message
### Server -> error handling

### custom error handler -> for preventing the server from accepting wrong information from the services like postman and hoppscoth.
